He wrote in a panoply of forms and genres \\nabout a great variety of topics and settings, drawing on his experiences \\nof living, working, and travelling in Scotland and England, in Europe \\nand the Mediterranean, and in North America. Yet only a fraction of \\nhis many works have been reprinted since their original publication. \\nIn 1841–43 Galt’s most important publisher, Blackwood, reprinted \\nseven of his novels in volumes 1, 2, 4, and 6 of the Blackwood’s Standard \\nNovels series. In 1895, the Blackwood firm republished these novels, \\nwith one change to the selection, as the eight-volume Works of John \\nGalt; this collection was reissued in 1936, again with one additional \\nnovel. Modern annotated editions of some individual works have \\nappeared since then. However, the Edinburgh Edition of the Works of \\nJohn Galt presents for the first time a much fuller range of Galt’s fiction \\nin authoritative texts, together with materials that add to an appre\\xad\\nciation of his historical surroundings and his cultural heritage. Each \\nvolume includes an introduction that places Galt’s work in the con\\xad\\ntext of history, genre, and the print culture of the period; annotations \\nthat explain specialized vocabulary as well as historical, geographical, \\nliterary, cultural, and philosophical allusions; and other features such \\nas a glossary of Scots words and expressions, maps, and excerpts that \\nilluminate Galt’s sources and his contemporary reception.\\nGalt wrote and published his work quickly, sending portions of \\nmanuscript to the printer to be set in type as soon as he finished them; \\nhe and his publisher would frequently correct proofs of part of a text \\nwhile he continued writing the remainder. Although he was usually \\nbusy with several projects at once, his correspondence documents his \\ninvolvement in all stages of the publication process and shows that he \\nundertook proof-corrections himself, except in cases where he devel\\xad\\noped especially close working relationships with a publisher or fellow \\nwriter and allowed that person editorial control. However, with few \\nexceptions, no manuscripts or proofs of Galt’s published fiction have \\nsurvived. For many of his works, only a single edition appeared during'),\n",

Sometimes there were one or more \\xadfurther editions, lightly \\nrevised and corrected; in other cases, the text was originally published \\nin a periodical and then revised for publication in book form. As a \\ngeneral editorial principle, subject to adaptation based on research \\nby the editors and the particular publishing history of each text, the \\npresent edition adopts as the copy-text the latest version in which \\nGalt is known to have had a hand. In the case of texts first published \\nin periodicals and later revised by Galt to appear as a book, the book \\npublication is preferred as the copy-text. Each volume of the present \\nedition includes the editor’s account of the composition and publica\\xad\\ntion history of Galt’s text, with reference to extant versions in the form \\nof periodical publications, multiple book editions, and manuscript \\nmaterials. All editorial emendations to the copy-text are recorded in a \\nlist of emendations at the end of the volume. The Edinburgh Edition of \\nthe Works of John Galt presents Galt’s fiction accurately as it appeared \\nduring his lifetime, reflecting his intentions to the extent that they can \\nbe ascertained. \\nGalt’s work was thoroughly interwoven with the publishing prac\\xad\\ntices and reading habits of his age. He wrote for currently popular \\npublication venues such as monthly magazines and literary annuals; \\nhe acquiesced to the expected format of the three-volume novel, but \\nalso attempted to popularize alternative forms such as single-volume \\n\\xadnovels and shorter fiction. His works therefore present a \\xadrevealing \\n\\xadpic\\xadture of the literary marketplace during the second and third \\ndecades of the nineteenth century. The Edinburgh Edition of the Works \\nof John Galt highlights these insights through the editors’ contextu\\xad\\nalizing notes on early-nineteenth-century print culture and through \\nthe presentation of Galt’s texts on the page. With respect to page \\nlayout, font, punctuation, and many other details, this edition seeks \\nto replicate the look of Galt’s original editions while providing an \\nenjoyable reading experience for modern readers. The editors hope \\nthat the results will make Galt’s clever, insightful, multifaceted, often \\ninnovative fiction accessible to a wide range of readers and researchers, \\nand reaffirm Galt’s importance within literary history.\\npreface\\nviii'),\n",

Glenfell is his first publication in the style of Scottish \\nfiction for which he would become best known; Andrew of Padua, the \\nImprovisatore is a unique synthesis of his experiences with theatre, \\n\\xadeducational writing, and travel in the Mediterranean; and The Omen is \\na haunting gothic tale. Each story was originally published in one short \\nvolume – a form that Galt preferred, but one that found little favour \\nwith publishers, circulating libraries, and readers in an age dominated \\nby triple-decker novels. Thus, the history of how these tales came to \\nbe written and published demonstrates Galt’s entrepreneurial efforts \\nto bring shorter fiction onto the literary market. With their easily \\nreadable scope and their vivid themes, each of the three stories has a \\ndistinct charm. At the same time, they cast light on significant phases \\nin Galt’s career as a writer and on his versatility in experimenting with \\nnew themes and styles.\\nThe Periodical Novelist, or The Circulating Library\\nGlenfell and Andrew of Padua were part of the same publishing venture: \\na series of short novels for which Galt, albeit anonymously, seems to \\nhave been a prime mover. During the years 1819 and 1820, he lived \\nin London and published heavily with the firms of Richard Phillips \\nand John Souter. Besides contributing articles to Phillips’ Monthly \\n\\xadMagazine, Galt compiled pedagogical works on history and geography \\nfor the use of schoolchildren; most of these appeared under the pseu\\xad\\ndonyms “Reverend T. Clark” and “Captain Samuel Prior.” He was forty \\nyears old, and his writing career up to this point comprised moderately \\nsuccessful accounts of his travels in the Mediterranean, biographies, \\ndramas, articles on political economy and other non-fictional topics, \\nand a large number of school textbooks. His only fictional publication, \\na two-volume tale entitled The Majolo that appeared in 1815–16, had \\nfallen flat. \\nNevertheless, in 1819 the publisher Phillips and his regular writer'),\n",

This series of “superior new \\nNovels and Novellettes” was first announced in the October 1819 issue \\nof Phillips’ Monthly Magazine; it was to consist partly of “translations \\nfrom the French, Italian, German, Spanish, and oriental languages” \\nand partly of original works for which “some of the first writers of \\nthe day have pledged their co-operation.”1 Over the next five months, \\nit was advertised in the Monthly Magazine as a “Periodical Series of \\nOriginal Novels, Romances, and Tales,” “Novelties for Novel \\xadReaders,” \\nand “Classical New Novels.”2 Besides the eminence of the writers \\nand the quality of the translations, a particular selling point was to be \\nthe reliable and relatively affordable price of six shillings per \\xadvolume, \\n\\xadregardless of the volume’s length. The series was published under \\ntwo interchangeable titles, The Periodical Novelist and The Circulating \\n\\xadLibrary, both of which suggest an attempt to capitalize on contempo\\xad\\nrary reading habits. The “Advertisement to the Series” that was printed \\nat the beginning of volume 1 – that is, Galt’s Glenfell – is quite explicit \\nabout the intention to woo circulating libraries as well as private pur\\xad\\nchasers by providing a commodity that is available at a “cheap rate,” yet \\ncounts as “a monthly luxury above all price” (2–3).3\\nThe advertisement also intimates that the series will allow for quick \\npublication (“an early view”) of work by new authors (“literary \\n\\xadamateurs”), and that it will be a venue for tales that “would probably \\nhave been rejected by the modern publishers of Novels, on account \\nof their brevity” (2–3). This attempt to create an alternative outlet for \\npublication hints at Galt’s collaboration in the series from the begin\\xad\\nning, since it resembles other projects he had previously undertaken. \\nSome six years earlier, Galt pitched a similar monthly series of dramas \\nto publisher Henry Colburn, to be entitled The Rejected Theatre; it was \\nto include plays that had been turned down by the licensed theatres \\nof Covent Garden and Drury Lane. The provocative title reflected \\nGalt’s frustration over the rejection of plays he himself had submitted \\nfor performance and his suspicion that the theatre managers had not \\nbothered to read them properly, if at all.4 The Rejected Theatre was soon \\n1 The Monthly Magazine; or, British Register, 48 (1819), p. 262.\\n2 Monthly Magazine, 48 (1819), p. 347; 49 (1820), p. 70; 49 (1820), p. 156.\\n3 When no further specification is given, numbers in parentheses refer to \\npages in the present volume.\\n4 See The Autobiography of John Galt, 2 vols (London: Cochrane and McCrone, \\n1833), I, p. 264.\\nintroduction\\nxvi'),\n",

Galt drew on The New British Theatre in \\nvarious ways when writing tales for the Periodical Novelist series, as is \\nespecially evident in Andrew of Padua’s engagement with the world \\nof the theatre. But The Periodical Novelist proved even more short-\\nlived than The New British Theatre; after three volumes – two of them \\n\\xadwritten by Galt – it quietly folded. Because of Galt’s heavy involvement \\nwith this monthly series and because of what it reveals about some of \\nhis earliest forays into the marketplace for fiction, the title pages and \\nprefatory material for the Periodical Novelist or Circulating Library are \\nincluded in the present edition.\\nGlenfell; or, Macdonalds and Campbells\\nGalt’s two anonymously published contributions to the series are \\n\\xadnevertheless remarkable, each in its own way.

Although long forgotten, this delightful story \\nis key to an understanding of Galt’s development as a writer because \\nit is his first publication in the style that soon after made him famous: \\nthe humorous, socially and historically insightful tale of Scottish life. \\nBoth of Glenfell’s subtitles are significant for locating the book \\nwithin historical and literary contexts. The subtitle Macdonalds \\nand Campbells simultaneously raises and defuses expectations of a \\n\\xaddramatic historical plot that might have centered on centuries-old \\nfeuds between the Macdonald and Campbell clans, evoking un\\xadre\\xad\\nsolved tensions within Highland society that Galt’s Scottish readers \\nwould have associated with the 1692 Massacre of Glencoe. But, with its \\nomission of definite articles, the phrase “Macdonalds and Campbells” \\n(rather than “the Macdonalds and the Campbells”) carries somewhat \\ndifferent connotations, hinting instead at the confusion of names and \\nidentities that underlies the novel’s comic plot. The action of Glenfell \\nplays itself out among several Macdonalds and several Campbells \\nresiding comfortably in the small compass of Edinburgh’s New Town, \\nwhich had just completed building at the time the novel appeared and \\nwas attracting Highland families to the city in increasing numbers. \\n\\xadAlthough Galt’s family came from lowland Ayrshire, he had Highland \\nintroduction\\nxvii'),\n",

Due to his work \\nwith the Caledonian Asylum, a charitable organization for orphaned \\nScottish children, he had been involved with the Highland Society \\nof London since 1814; in 1818, he became a Director of the Highland \\nSociety in Greenock, a town that already had a significant Highland \\npopulation when Galt was growing up there during the 1790s. Later, \\nin his memoirs, he mentions the Gaelic associations of the Galt name \\nand his own possible ancestry in the Highlands of Perthshire.5 While \\nthe disruption and depopulation of Highland communities from the \\nmid-eighteenth century onward forms a larger historical backdrop to \\nthe novel, the action of Glenfell confines itself to a small, domestic scale. \\nIts sphere is that of professional and fashionable life; its characters \\nrange from members of the middle class such as the businessman Mr. \\nRuart to hereditary nobility such as the Laird of Glenfell who, while \\nhe has taken up the practice of law in Edinburgh, remains a clan chief. \\nMost importantly, it is about the ways these classes have begun to \\nintermingle – in the friendship of Glenfell and Ruart, who are former \\nschoolmates, in intermarriages between classes and clans, and in the \\nrelocation of Highlanders to Edinburgh and Glasgow. By focusing on \\nsocial interactions among Macdonalds, Campbells, and other High\\xad\\nland families in these rapidly changing communities, Galt anticipates \\nthe perspective his fiction would take vis-à-vis larger historical move\\xad\\nments in Annals of the Parish and other novels of the following years. \\nGlenfell’s second subtitle, An Edinburgh Tale of the Nineteenth \\n\\xadCentury, also evokes and undercuts expectations. It gestures toward \\nthe genre of the historical novel that Walter Scott had popularized \\nsix years earlier; but instead of offering a tale of eighteenth-century \\nadventure in the manner of Scott’s Waverley (1814), Galt locates his \\ncharacters in a nineteenth-century social world more akin to those \\nof Maria Edgeworth and Jane Austen. All the events of Glenfell occur \\non a restrained domestic scale, beginning with a misdelivered issue of \\nthe Edinburgh Review, climaxing with a bankruptcy negotiation, and \\nending with the marriages of Macdonalds and Campbells and Glenfell \\nhimself. Urban geography plays an important part throughout Glenfell. \\nIn 1820, Edinburgh’s New Town was brand new; the residential district \\nbuilt by architects Robert Adam and Robert Reid based on the plans \\nlaid out by James Craig in the 1760s had just been completed.

By introducing a subplot about the Glasgow \\nmerchant Mr. Ruart into the story, Galt also depicts the relationship \\nbetween professional Edinburgh and mercantile Glasgow as he has \\ncharacters travel from one city to the other along ever-accelerating \\nstagecoach routes.\\nGalt’s experience as a dramatist is clearly evident in Glenfell. He \\nbased the novel on “Auld Reekie; or, a Mistake in Edinburgh,” a play \\nhe had written sometime during the preceding decade but only pub\\xad\\nlished much later in volume 3 of his Literary Life, and Miscellanies (1834). \\nMore specifically, Glenfell’s plot resembles French comédie \\xadd’intrigue in \\nthe use of mistaken identities, the predominance of dialogue, and an \\napproximate unity of time. The events take place over a very few days, \\nand the scene shifts back and forth between simultaneous goings-on in \\nEdinburgh and Glasgow. There are frequent quotations from and allu\\xad\\nsions to Shakespeare, which Galt uses to parallel the domestic drama \\nof Glenfell with Shakespearean comedies of mistaken identity and \\nhyperbolically juxtapose it with tragedy.6 All thirty-five chapters begin \\nwith epigraphs that are drawn from thirteen different Shakespearean \\nplays and from a wide variety of eighteenth-century British literature. \\nThese epigraphs embed Galt’s modest tale within an \\xadelaborate, if ironic, \\nliterary heritage.\\nGalt’s recent, busy months of writing educational texts for \\nPhillips and Souter also influenced the composition of Glenfell. As mis\\xad\\nidentifications of Macdonalds and Campbells proliferate throughout \\nthe novel, Galt allows his reader to fall into some of these misunder\\xad\\nstandings along with the characters in order to instill a \\xadlesson about \\nreading attentively. Not until chapter 5 does the omniscient narrator \\nclear up some of the initial confusion with a pedantic aside: “Here \\nit becomes necessary to apprise the reader that in our Northern \\n\\xadComedy of Errors there are two Macdonalds as well as two Miss \\nCampbells” (20). Further misunderstandings are stirred up, however, \\nby the \\xadnovel’s title character – the young, rich, handsome, poetically \\ninclined lawyer Glenfell, whose impulsive actions and fondness for \\nmaking rhetorical arguments that he doesn’t actually believe cause \\n6 Galt’s engagement with Shakespeare around this time may also be reflected \\nin a long review article of Nathan Drake’s Shakespeare and his Times in the \\nApril 1819 issue of the Edinburgh Monthly Review, which Ian A.

The educative theme shows up again in \\nGlenfell’s character development: he is taught by the emotional whirl\\xad\\nwind of the novel’s events to amend his eccentric, devil’s-advocate \\ndemeanour and become a “proselyte to propriety” (117). \\nThe story’s happy ending involves a deus ex machina in the person \\nof rich Mr. Grant, yet another Campbell relative who has just returned \\nto Scotland after thirty-five years in colonial Upper Canada. The \\ncolonial motif aligns with Galt’s evolving business interests. Although \\nhis first voyage to Canada was still a few years away, he had learned \\nenough detail about the country from an emigrant relative to publish \\na “Statistical Account of Upper Canada” in the Philosophical Magazine \\nin 1807, and Canada would become a central focus of his own business \\naffairs by the end of 1820, when he was appointed agent for Canadian \\nclaimants seeking compensation from the British government.

The long-absent Highlander \\nMr. Grant ironically calls attention to this change in morés when he \\nreflects:\\nI am a little sorry that we have been so easily reconciled, for \\nI do not much like this modern moderation of feeling, this \\ndebating about the equity of things.

The novel climaxes not with a battle, but \\nwith a bankruptcy hearing; its triumphal celebration is a dinner party \\nenlivened by satire and a dose of slapstick comedy. \\nGlenfell is thus of significant interest as Galt’s first published \\n\\xadScottish novel and the first example of his distinctive approach to \\ndepicting the social history of his country. More specifically, Glenfell \\nintroduces names and scenes that he would develop further in the \\npopular novels that followed.

A brief section entitled “An Improvisatore” recounts \\nhis meeting with an unnamed individual in Sicily who vaunts his own \\nservices as a tour guide, claiming to be “the best \\xadimprovisatore in all \\nPalermo.” As in Andrew of Padua, the narrator invites the improvvisa\\xad\\ntore to visit him at his lodgings, only to have his landlord advise him \\nto avoid this character at all costs: “‘Oh my God!’ cried he, ‘that is \\none grand Furbo … When he come again, you tell him to go to hell’.”12 \\nThe character of Andrew of Padua is an amalgam of the “grand Furbo” \\nof an improvvisatore whom Galt himself encountered in \\xadPalermo, and \\na more sympathetic improvising performer who appears in another \\nearly \\xadpublication of Galt’s: the biography of \\xadAmerican painter Ben\\xad\\njamin West, a significant part of which is devoted to West’s trip to \\nItaly in 1759–60. While in a coffee-house in Rome, West encounters \\n“the most celebrated Improvisatore in all Italy.” This improvvisatore \\nis described as “a venerable old man, with a guitar” who goes by the \\nname of “Homer” (the same epithet claimed by Andrew of Padua) \\nand extemporizes an impressive ode on the theme of “an American \\ncome to study the fine arts in Rome” – that is to say, on Benjamin \\nWest himself.13 The episode of West’s encounter with the Roman \\nimprovvisatore called Homer in 1760 makes it possible to take at face \\nvalue the few chronological markers in Andrew of Padua: the trans\\xad\\nlator’s \\xadopening remark that “about sixty years ago” there was “a very \\n12 Voyages and Travels in the Years 1809, 1810, and 1811 (London: Cadell and \\nDavies, 1812), p. 45.\\n13 The Life and Studies of Benjamin West, Esq.

From the standpoint of 1820, when the story \\nwas published, this means that Andrew would have reached the height \\nof his fame in Rome in 1760 (“sixty years ago”) and his encounter \\nwith Furbo would have taken place in 1790 (“thirty years ago”), when \\nAndrew had become an old man. Most of the remaining historical allu\\xad\\nsions in both the biographical sketch and Andrew’s tale fall into place \\naround those dates – with the exception of a mischievous footnote, in \\nthe midst of a chapter about the credibility of storytellers, where the \\ntranslator claims that Furbo wrote this tale “before the establishment \\nof the independence of the United States” (194). Since Galt was pre\\xad\\nparing the second \\xadvolume of his \\xadbiography of Benjamin West for the \\npress simultaneously with Andrew of Padua, it is not surprising that \\ntraces of West’s adventures made their way into Andrew of Padua’s \\nstory.\\nIn other ways, too, the most illuminating frame of reference for \\nAndrew of Padua is Galt’s own writing career. The story gradually \\nreveals more and more elaborate correspondences with the many \\ntypes of writing at which he had tried his hand: travel accounts, \\ndrama, opera librettos, biography, fiction. These allusions are some\\xad\\ntimes quirky or satirical, other times so precise as to make Andrew of \\nPadua look like an allegory of Galt’s experiences in the publishing and \\ntheatrical world of London during the years 1812 to 1819. The motif \\nof flute-playing, for instance, crops up repeatedly in Galt’s early work. \\nThe hero of The Majolo plays the flute, as Galt did during his youth, \\nand as does Andrew of Padua. Indeed, Andrew’s temporary obsession \\nwith flute-playing is a bizarre episode that seems to function more as a \\ncoded authorial signature than an intrinsic part of the plot. Names and \\ncharacters that appear in Andrew of Padua are also to be found in The \\nEarthquake (1820), the long novel that Galt wrote while living in Scot\\xad\\nland in 1818. It features two improvvisatore characters: Salpano, “the \\nbest poet in all Sicily,” an extemporizer who is so talented that he could \\nhave made a killing on the London stage, and Andrea, an illiterate old \\nman who “often deceived his auditors into a belief that his stories were \\nactually his own adventures.”14 Andrew of Padua looks very much like \\n14 The Earthquake: A Tale, 3 vols (Edinburgh: Blackwood and London: Cadell, \\n1820), I, pp. 297–8 and II, p. 260. \\nintroduction\\nxxv'),\n",

The story makes the Italian improvvisatore into an avatar of the \\nBritish writer struggling to earn a living by grasping the opportunities \\noffered by the late-Romantic marketplace. Andrew of Padua’s theme of \\nthe poet-performer who literally sings for his supper had ironic per\\xad\\nsonal relevance for Galt as he wrote school textbooks, magazine articles, \\nand fiction for Richard Phillips and other publishers as quickly as it \\ncould be printed. The counting-house into which Galt places Andrew \\nin the early chapters, and the theatrical sphere in which Andrew later \\ntries to make his way, are worlds whose frustrations Galt knew all too \\nwell. Having failed to interest the Theatres Royal of London in the \\ntragedies and comedies he had written, Galt developed strong views \\non the shortcomings of the theatre industry that found expression in \\nThe New British Theatre, the volumes of rejected plays that he edited \\nin 1814–15. In chapter 16 of Andrew of Padua, Andrew outlines a \\xadlyrical \\ndrama that is actually an opera libretto entitled Orpheus, written and \\npublished by Galt himself in volume 3 of The New British Theatre. Even \\nwhen the allusion is less blatant than this, Galt’s own experiences with \\nthe London theatres clearly provide background for the novel. Galt is \\nnevertheless even-handed in his characterization of theatre managers: \\nthey range from the dignified manager of the opera house in Palermo \\nin chapter 18 who is credited with “solid attainments, … great skill, \\nand … exquisite taste” (207) to the agent of the London opera house \\nin chapter 19, a former tradesman who can easily be hoodwinked by \\nAndrew because he knows no Italian and “possesse[s] about as much \\ntaste in Italian music as his bidets” (209). \\nIn the context of magazine publishing, too, Andrew the improvvisa\\xad\\ntore is an all too realistic representation of Galt the “bookseller’s hack,” \\nas he sometimes called himself, wryly echoing a comment by John \\nCam Hobhouse.15 The plot device whereby Andrew manages to cajole \\na glass of wine or something to eat from his listener Furbo at the end \\nof almost every chapter might evoke Galt’s relation to his publishers, \\nfrom whom he was often obliged to ask for cash advances on his next \\npiece of writing.

In individual episodes as well as in \\nthe plot of the story as a whole, Galt tries to inculcate habits of careful \\nreading and observation by making fun of characters who allow them\\xad\\nselves to be hoodwinked. In chapter 15, for instance, while sailing from \\nLeghorn to Messina, Andrew takes part in a storytelling game where \\na multicultural group of passengers entertain one another with tall \\ntales. Andrew learns an important lesson about how not to be taken \\nin when a Frenchman poses as a learned member of the Academy of \\nSciences but turns out to be an ordinary barber. In Andrew of Padua as \\na whole, it is Francisco Furbo who eventually realizes that he has fallen \\nfor Andrew’s elaborate story about his international fame; listeners, \\nAndrew chides him, should learn to “exercise their own faculties a little \\nmore cleverly” (222) in order to avoid being cajoled out of their wine \\nand dinners by clever performers. Finally, with a paratextual apparatus \\nconsisting of the “Biographical Sketch of the Abbate Furbo” and foot\\xad\\nnotes by the pseudo-translator, Galt performs the same exercise on \\nhis actual readers, teaching us to be more prudent when it comes to \\nevaluating narrative authority.\\nAndrew of Padua is thus a lynchpin in Galt’s career between his \\nwriting of school texts and his association with the hoaxing group of \\nauthors involved with Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, for which he \\nbegan to write around this time.

On \\n18 May 1822, while sending William Blackwood portions of the book \\nmanuscript for The Steam-Boat, Galt also sent him a revised version \\nof “the Improvisatore” to be published as part of a collection that he \\ncalled “the Lazaretto.”19 In a letter of 28 May, he suggested that “the \\nQuarrantine” [sic] would be a better title for the collection of tales.20 \\nBlackwood appears to have declined the stories, but they came in \\nhandy in October 1824 when Galt, on the point of leaving for Canada, \\ndesperately needed to fill space in a three-volume historical novel he \\nwas publishing with Oliver & Boyd. In “The Quarantine; or, Tales of \\nthe Lazaretto,” which fills the second half of volume 3 of Galt’s Rothelan, \\nthe text of Andrew of Padua appears in recycled form as “The Improvi\\xad\\nsatoré; or, The Italian’s Tale.” This time, the pseudo-narrator Francisco \\nFurbo is replaced by a different frame story: “The Quarantine” takes \\nplace in Messina, Sicily, where an international group of travelers con\\xad\\nfined in the lazaretto because of the danger of plague decide to pass \\nthe time by telling stories to one another and assessing the credibility \\nof each storyteller. The Italian “Improvisatoré” relates the second of \\nthe three tales.

The \\nnames of Andrew Wylie, Provost Pawkie, and Lawrie Todd all encode, \\nin English or Scots, the wily character of their bearers, as does the name \\nof the Italian Francisco Furbo. Indeed, Galt’s choice of the typically \\nScottish name “Andrew” for his Italian improvvisatore is an indication \\nthat Italian and Scottish contexts are being superimposed in Andrew \\nof Padua. Ironically, the fiction of the imaginary author Francisco \\nFurbo proved so durable that Andrew of Padua is much more often \\nlisted under the pseudonym “Furbo” than under Galt’s own name, \\nboth in the catalogues of nineteenth-century circulating libraries and \\nin the few rare-book libraries that hold copies today.

His friend and early \\nbiographer D. M. Moir, aware of the difficult circumstances in which \\nthe tale was written, refers to it as “one of the most beautiful, and \\n\\xadperhaps the most elaborately finished of his productions.”24\\nGalt himself commented that The Omen is “not … at all in the \\nstyle for which I am best known.”25 As wide-ranging as his themes and \\ngenres had been up to this point, The Omen undertakes something \\n\\xaddifferent from almost all his previous writing. Its first-person \\xadnarrator \\nis a young English nobleman named Henry and it is set mainly in \\nOxford, parts of East Anglia, and the environs of London. The plot \\n\\xadfeatures a gothic motif of narrowly averted incest that was new to Galt’s \\nfiction, although he had paid considerable attention to similar themes \\nin Byron’s poetry. Recalling the origins of The Omen in his Literary Life, \\nGalt claims that “it is founded on the story to which I alluded to Lord \\nByron on speaking one day of the ‘Bride of Abydos’.”26 The story in \\nquestion is a four-volume novel entitled The Three \\xadBrothers by Joshua \\nPickersgill that was published in 1803. Galt was so struck by similari\\xad\\nties between The Bride of Abydos and this convoluted gothic romance \\nthat he returned several times to the question of whether Byron had \\nplagiarized The Three Brothers or perhaps even written it himself when \\nvery young.27 \\nWhile Galt intimates that The Omen also derives from this source, \\nany resemblance to The Three Brothers is very vague. Instead, there are \\nstronger connections to themes in some of his own earlier fiction. Galt \\nhad long been interested in premonitions, extrasensory perception, \\nand semi-mystical sympathies – as The Omen’s narrator puts it, in the \\nbelief that the mind may be “endowed with other faculties of percep\\xad\\ntion than those of the corporeal senses” (237).

In both The Majolo and The Omen, Galt distances himself \\nfrom a belief in omens by ascribing this belief to fictional characters \\nand exploring its effect on their psyche. He does, however, identify \\npersonally with another one of the psychological phenomena illus\\xad\\ntrated by The Omen: a mental faculty that he calls “local memory” \\nand that he believes himself to possess in a “remarkable” degree.29 \\nGalt glosses local memory as “the peculiarity of recalling objects of \\nsight, and describing them as if they were present”; according to the \\nexamples he gives in the Autobiography, it is a capacity for intense \\nvisualization that can recall vivid details of past scenes in a way that \\n“helps to make individuality and to mark identity.”30 In The Omen, Galt \\ntransfers the propensity for local memory to the protagonist Henry, \\nwhose sensorially vivid memories of scenes from his childhood might \\ntoday be described as flashbacks to childhood trauma.\\nOccasional scenes and motifs in The Omen can be traced to other \\nfacets of Galt’s experience.

The Gazette then quotes long passages of evocative scenery \\nand \\xadpsychological description so as to let readers “form their own \\nopinions upon the \\xadmerits or demerits of the Omen.”43 A brief review \\nin the New Times, a daily paper edited by John Stoddart, followed two \\ndays later; it consisted of a few sentences prefacing some extracts from \\nThe Omen. While it describes The Omen as “a series of beautifully con\\xad\\nceived, and beautifully executed scenes,” the New Times deems this \\nkind of episodic character description to show much less genius than a \\nwell-constructed plot.44 Both these reviews are only mildly negative, yet \\nGalt referred to them anxiously as “Jerdans strictures & Dr \\xadStoddarts”45 \\nand continued to resent them bitterly, Jerdan’s in particular. A much \\nlonger and more devastating review that appeared in the April issue \\nof Constable’s Edinburgh Magazine summarizes the entire story of The \\nOmen and quotes long excerpts that obliterate any suspense. With a \\ncombination of sarcasm and condescension, this review critiques the \\nsubject as “unpleasant,” the style as “inflated and hyperbolical,” and \\nthe incidents as “highly improbable”; it questions the originality of \\nthe tale and ridicules the theme of premonitions entirely.46 It ends \\nby attributing the novel to an unnamed Irish author – likely William \\nMaginn or Barry St Leger, although the reviewer’s specific reference \\nto “Belfast” might even point toward John Banim, who was in Belfast \\nat the time. Another negative review came in the March issue of the \\nMonthly Review. Summarizing the plot of the story briefly, this review \\ncriticizes its second half as being melodramatic and improbable, “in \\nthe very worst style of the German school,” and \\xadspeculates that the \\nnovel is the “‘maiden’ production” of a Scottish author.47\\nNotwithstanding this discouraging initial reception, Galt remained \\nso engaged with the mystical theme of The Omen that a month after \\nits publication he began to write a kind of sequel, immediately taking \\n43 The Literary Gazette, and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, &c., 475 (25 \\nFebruary 1826), pp. 116–18.\\n44 The New Times, 27 February 1826, p. 1.\\n45 Galt to William Blackwood, 2 March 1826, MS 4017, NLS.\\n46 The Edinburgh Magazine, and Literary Miscellany, n.s. 97 (January–June \\n1826), pp. 433–45; here, pp. 435 and 445.\\n47 The Monthly Review, n.s. 1 (1826), pp. 335–6.\\nintroduction\\nxxxvi'),\n",

In any case, no further edition of The Omen \\nin English materialized during Galt’s lifetime, although a few trans\\xad\\nlations appeared during the early 1830s. A Russian version entitled \\nПредзнаменование (Predznamenovanie), translated by G. Pasynkov, \\nwas published in St. Petersburg in 1831 – albeit with the subtitle “A \\nstory by Walter Scott” (повесть Вальтер-Скотта, Povest’ Valter-\\nSkotta). A Danish translation entitled Varselstegnet by Hans Christian \\nWosemose appeared in six instalments in a Copenhagen periodical in \\nJune and July 1832; it was based on a German translation by Johann \\nAugust Diezmann that has not been traced.\\nUnlike the other two short novels in the present volume, The Omen \\nsuited the taste of Victorian readers and was occasionally republished \\nin the later nineteenth century. Within a few years of Galt’s death in \\n1839, The Omen appeared twice in different collections of short prose. \\nFirst, in 1842, it was included in volume 4 of the original series of \\nBlackwood’s Standard Novels, four volumes of which were devoted to \\nGalt’s work. This version, which was edited by Galt’s literary executor \\nD. M. Moir, completely omits The Omen’s postscript, thus reducing the \\ncomplexity of the tale by removing the skeptical voice of the \\xadeditor “B. \\nA. M.” The postscript did appear in an American republication of The \\nOmen as part of a compendium of six short novels by British authors \\nentitled The Omnibus of Modern Romance. Despite the inclusion of the \\nironic postscript, however, the tone of this reprint was significantly \\naltered by the addition of a subtitle that reads: “The Omen: A Tale \\nof Real Life. By John Galt.” In place of Galt’s original epigraph from \\nShakespeare, a couple of sentences from Scott’s review serve as a \\nheadnote to the story in order to substantiate its supposed truth: “The \\nreal merits of the work consists [sic] in the beauty of its language and \\nthe truth of the descriptions introduced. Yet even these are kept in \\nsubordination to the main interest of the piece. This remarkable story \\nwe have every reason to believe accurate matter of fact, at least in its \\ngeneral \\xadbearings.”55 The Omen was republished once more (with the \\n54 Galt to William Blackwood, 6 September 1826, MS 4017, NLS.\\n55 The Omnibus of Modern Romance (New York: James Mowatt, 1844), vol. \\nI, no. 2, p. 145.

He moved through the crowd\\nlike an invalid elephant, with a child’s curiosity in the\\ninner workings of each thing he saw, for the world appeared\\nto him as an immense wind-up toy with which life invented\\nitself.\\nI have never known anyone closer to the idea one has\\nof a Renaissance pope: He was gluttonous and refined.\\nEven against his will, he always presided at the table.\\nMatilde, his wife, would put a bib around his neck that\\nbelonged in a barbershop rather than a dining room, but it\\nwas the only way to keep him from taking a bath in sauce.\\nThat day at Carvalleiras was typical. He ate three whole\\nlobsters, dissecting them with a surgeon’s skill, and at the\\nsame time devoured everyone else’s plate with his eyes\\nand tasted a little from each with a delight that made the\\ndesire to eat contagious: clams from Galicia, mussels from\\nCantabria, prawns from Alicante, sea cucumbers from the\\nCosta Brava. In the meantime, like the French, he spoke\\nof nothing but other culinary delicacies, in particular the\\nprehistoric shellfish of Chile, which he carried in his heart.\\nAll at once he stopped eating, tuned his lobster’s antennae,\\nand said to me in a very quiet voice:\\n‘There’s someone behind me who won’t stop looking at\\nme.’\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",

With the continuous advancement of neural net-\\nworks and deep learning, text embeddings have evolved from early sparse representa-\\ntions (e.g., BM25[1]) to dense representations based on ﬁne-tuned deep networks such\\nas BERT[2] and T5[3], leading to signiﬁcant performance improvements[4][5][6][7][8]. In\\n2022, the rise of large language models (LLMs), exempliﬁed by ChatGPT[9], ushered in\\na new era of text embeddings based on LLM representations, including models like text-\\nembedding-3-large and RepLLaMA[10]. Recent research on optimizing text embedding\\nmodels has explored diverse perspectives and focal points. For instance, to address\\nthe limitation of decoder-only architectures—where causal attention mechanisms re-\\nstrict token embeddings to unidirectional semantic capture—several approaches have\\nbeen proposed: Echo Embedding[11] employs input repetition and instruction design\\nto enable preceding tokens to capture subsequent token semantics. LLM2Vec[12] modi-\\nﬁes attention to bi-directional mechanism to remove backward dependency constraints.\\nConan-Embedding-v2[13] proposes a novel soft masking mechanism combined with dy-\\nnamic rank reduction.\\nAnother widely adopted approach is knowledge distillation,\\nwhere text embeddings are treated as the ”signal states” representing textual seman-\\ntics. By distilling knowledge from high-performing teacher models to student models,\\nthe objective is to optimize the embedding performance. For instance, Jasper[14] em-\\nploys a multi-stage knowledge distillation framework, combining with multiple carefully\\ndesigned loss functions and ﬁnally achieving superior results. Debater[16] proposes a\\nstep-by-step thinking mechanism for embedding generation, iteratively optimizing doc-\\nument representations through continuous COT. Distillation is applied to constrain\\nthe ﬁnal token representation to learn the optimal semantic states from these thinking\\nsteps. Additionally, hard negative sampling has emerged as a crucial research direc-\\ntion in text embedding models, serving as a pivotal technique for model optimization.\\nANCE[18] identiﬁed that conventional dense retrieval training leads to diminishing gra-\\ndient norms during optimization. Thus they developed an asynchronous Approximate\\nNearest Neighbor (ANN) indexing mechanism that periodically refreshes the negative\\nsample pool using the current model parameters, thereby ensuring the maintenance\\nof up-to-date and optimally challenging negative samples. Both Conan-Embedding[24]\\nand its v2 version incorporated similar dynamic hard negative sampling techniques to\\nenhance model performance. NV-Embed[19] implemented an alternative approach by\\nleveraging their previously developed NV-Retriever’s[20] positive-aware negative min-\\ning strategy, including TopK-MarginPos and TopKPercPos ﬁltering mechanisms.\\nIn this work, we present QZhou-Embedding, built upon the powerful Qwen2.5-7B-\\nInstruct[21] model, which pushes the boundaries of text embedding capabilities. To\\nenhance the model’s semantic understanding, we designed a uniﬁed multi-task learn-\\ning framework that not only accommodates more diverse training data but also bring\\neﬃcient learning across three key tasks: retrieval, natural language inference (NLI),\\nand classiﬁcation. Our framework comprises two core components: 1. Data Trans-\\nformation: We carefully adapt data formats to the speciﬁc requirements of retrieval,\\nNLI, and classiﬁcation tasks, enabling eﬀective feature extraction from heterogeneous\\ndata sources, signiﬁcantly beneﬁting retrieval model training. 2. Training Strategy:\\nWe designed specialized loss functions based on each task’s characteristics, optimizing\\nmodel training eﬃciency.

Our approach distinctively reformulates NLI tasks into\\ntext pair-score formats compatible with Cosent loss[49] training strategy, where sample\\npairs are quantitatively scored based on their semantic relationships. The processing\\nprocedures for each are detailed below:\\n• STS Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is characterized by its symmetric se-\\nmantic matching to determine whether two sentences share equivalent meaning.\\nSTS datasets typically consist of sentence pairs with associated labels, which may\\nbe binary classiﬁcations (yes/no, true/false) or numerical scores (e.g., 1.2, 3.1,\\n4.8). For binary labels, ”yes”/”true” are mapped to a numerical value of 1, while\\n”no”/”false” are converted to 0. The data is then structured into (query, docu-\\nment, score) triplets. Due to the symmetric nature of STS, each single original\\ndata sample can generate two training triplets by interchanging the query and\\npositive document roles.\\n• Textual Entailment Textual entailment further examines a model’s capabilities\\nin reasoning, typically featuring three-class labels: entailment, neutral, contradic-\\ntion.\\nOur processing method employs a three-tier scoring system: labels are\\nassigned values of 2, 1, and 0 for entailment, neutral, and contradiction respec-\\ntively.

We designed a\\nuniﬁed multi-task framework comprising specialized data transformation and training\\nstrategies, eﬀectively enhanced the diversity of training data. To further improve the\\nquality of training data and the model’s generalization capabilities, we developed a data\\nsynthesis pipeline leveraging LLM API, incorporating techniques such as Paraphrasing,\\nAugmentation, and Hard negative example generation. We employ a two-stage training\\nstrategy comprising initial retrieval-focused training followed by full-task ﬁne-tuning,\\nenabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities based on robust retrieval per-\\nformance.\\nThe model achieves state-of-the-art results on the MTEB and CMTEB\\nbenchmarks, ranking ﬁrst on both leaderboards. Our ﬁndings establish that data qual-\\nity and diversity are pivotal for improving embedding model capabilities. In the future,\\nwe will focus on developing multimodal and multilingual embedding models, as well\\nas exploring eﬀective applications of embedding models in agent systems, aiming to\\nintegrate cutting-edge technologies to optimize this classical module.\\nReferences\\n[1] Robertson, Stephen E., and Steve Walker. ”Some simple eﬀective approximations to\\nthe 2-poisson model for probabilistic weighted retrieval.” In SIGIR’94: Proceedings\\n16'),\n",

To further improve the\\nquality of training data and the model’s generalization capabilities, we developed a data\\nsynthesis pipeline leveraging LLM API, incorporating techniques such as Paraphrasing,\\nAugmentation, and Hard negative example generation. We employ a two-stage training\\nstrategy comprising initial retrieval-focused training followed by full-task ﬁne-tuning,'),\n",

We employ a two-stage training\\nstrategy comprising initial retrieval-focused training followed by full-task ﬁne-tuning,\\nenabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities based on robust retrieval per-\\nformance.\\nThe model achieves state-of-the-art results on the MTEB and CMTEB\\nbenchmarks, ranking ﬁrst on both leaderboards. Our ﬁndings establish that data qual-\\nity and diversity are pivotal for improving embedding model capabilities. In the future,\\nwe will focus on developing multimodal and multilingual embedding models, as well\\nas exploring eﬀective applications of embedding models in agent systems, aiming to\\nintegrate cutting-edge technologies to optimize this classical module.\\nReferences\\n[1] Robertson, Stephen E., and Steve Walker. ”Some simple eﬀective approximations to\\nthe 2-poisson model for probabilistic weighted retrieval.” In SIGIR’94: Proceedings\\n16'),\n",
